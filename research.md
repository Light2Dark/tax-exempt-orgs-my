# Tax-exempted Donation Organizations in Malaysia

This document provides an overview of the main provisions in Malaysian tax law that govern tax-exempted donation organizations and the tax benefits available to donors.

## Subsection 44(6) of the Income Tax Act 1967

Subsection 44(6) of the Income Tax Act 1967 (ITA) enables the Director General of Inland Revenue (DGIR) to approve non-profit institutions, organizations, or funds, allowing donors to claim tax deductions on cash contributions. Approved entities are exempt from income tax, while donors can deduct donations up to 10% of their aggregate income.

### Key Aspects of Subsection 44(6) ITA 1967:

- **Eligibility & Purpose**: The institution must be non-profit, operate for charitable, educational, or other public-interest purposes, and have operated for at least two years.
- **Approval Process**: Approval is not automatic; it requires application to the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (LHDNM, also known as HASiL) and adherence to strict guidelines.
- **Tax Benefits**:
  - **For Donors**: Gifts of money to approved institutions are deductible, limited to 10% of the aggregate income of the donor. This limit applies to the combined total of donations under various subsections of Section 44.
  - **For Organizations**: The approved entity is exempt from income tax on income (excluding dividends).
- **Validity**: Approvals under 44(6) generally last up to 10 years, after which re-application is necessary.
- **Compliance**: Failure to maintain proper records or adhere to conditions can lead to revocation of approval, as seen with the National Kidney Foundation in 2019.
- **Recent Updates**: Effective August 20, 2024, new guidelines were issued by LHDNM to govern these institutions.

## Subsection 44(11D) of the Income Tax Act 1967

Subsection 44(11D) of the Income Tax Act 1967 provides a tax deduction for cash, wakaf (Islamic endowment), or endowment contributions made to approved religious authorities, bodies, or public universities. The deduction is limited to a maximum of 10% of the donor's aggregate income, often in combination with other donation deductions.

### Key Details Regarding Subsection 44(11D):

- **Eligible Contributions**: Only cash donations in the form of wakaf to approved religious authorities/bodies or endowments to public universities are permitted.
- **Purpose**: The contribution must aim to fulfill the establishment objectives of the religious authority, body, or university.
- **Approval**: The recipient entity must be approved by the Director General of Inland Revenue (DGIR).
- **Conditions**: For endowments, the principal amount must generally be preserved, and only the returns (income generated) used.
- **Deduction Limit**: The total deduction for these contributions, together with other donations under 44(6), 44(11B), and 44(11C), is capped at 10% of the donor's aggregate income.

This provision encourages donations to specific institutions, such as those listed by the [Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia (LHDN)](https://www.hasil.gov.my/en/quick-links/services/donation-approval/subsection-44-11d-of-the-income-tax-act-1967/).

## P.U.(A) 139/2020

The Income Tax (Exemption) Order 2020 [P.U. (A) 139] was gazetted on 4 May 2020 to provide 100% income tax exemption on all sources of income for religious institutions or organizations registered as a company limited by guarantee and incorporated under the Companies Act 2016.

**Note**: This exemption is separate from the donation deduction provisions under Section 44(6) and 44(11D). It provides tax exemption to the religious institution itself, rather than tax deductions for donors.

## Important Notes for Donors

- The 10% deduction limit applies to the **combined total** of donations made under various subsections of Section 44, including 44(6), 44(11B), 44(11C), and 44(11D).
- Only donations to **approved** institutions qualify for tax deductions. Always verify that the recipient organization is on the official LHDN approved list.
- Keep proper documentation of all donations for tax filing purposes.
